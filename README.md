My coding exercise answers for Reinforcement Learning by Stutton and Barto.

I will update the repository as I go through the book, slowly, in my part time.

## Contents
#### exercise_{a}_{b}.py

## My coding style

- Loop for losers and `ndarray` for life
- Clean code enthusiast
- Object oriented to the death
